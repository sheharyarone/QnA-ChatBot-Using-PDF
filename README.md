## Features
- **Chatbot GUI**: An interactive Graphical User Interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- **PDF Question Answering**: The ability to process and answer questions based on content available in PDF documents.
- **Model Training Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for training sentence transformer models on specific datasets.
- **Trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models using sentence transformers for immediate deployment.
